# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a two-player game, played on a 3 × 3 grid represented by nine squares. Players need to choose
Circle or Cross. And the game starts with the circle player's turn. After placing their symbol, the turn
switches to the other player. The player's turn is indicated by the text in the "details" element. The game
checks for a win condition after each player's turn. If any player has three of their symbols in a row
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), that player wins. The winning player is displayed in the "details"
element. If there are no empty squares left on the game board and no player has won, the game ends in
a draw. When the game ends (either a win or a draw), the board is reset, and a new game can be started.
